# mc

Mail Composer — compose, draft, and send emails from markdown via the Gmail API. Wraps gmailr to reduce email scripts from 80 lines of boilerplate to 3.

## Repository Context

**Repository:** NewGraphEnvironment/mc
**Primary Language:** R
**License:** MIT
**Status:** Early development (0.0.0.9000)

## Architecture

- `R/` — Package source: `mc_auth`, `mc_compose`, `mc_md_render`, `mc_scroll`, `mc_send`, `mc_sig`, `mc_thread_find`
- `man/` — roxygen2-generated docs
- `vignettes/` — pkgdown vignettes (tables-in-emails)
- `tests/testthat/` — testthat v3 tests
- `data-raw/` — Data preparation scripts
- `inst/` — Installed files (signature template, etc.)
- `dev/` — Development scripts

## Key Patterns

- Markdown envelope above `---` is stripped by `mc_md_render()` before HTML conversion
- `mc_compose()` accepts mixed markdown files, raw HTML, and kable objects
- `mc_scroll()` wraps HTML tables for horizontal/vertical scrolling in email clients
- Input validation uses `chk` package on all exported functions
- HTML conversion via `commonmark`
- Gmail API interaction via `gmailr`

## Development

- `devtools::document()` to rebuild NAMESPACE and man pages
- `devtools::test()` to run tests
- `pkgdown::build_site()` for docs site
- Follow tidyverse/r-lib conventions (roxygen2 markdown, testthat v3)

# Cartography

## Style Registry

Use the `gq` package for all shared layer symbology. Never hardcode hex color values when a registry style exists.

```r
library(gq)
reg <- gq_reg_main()  # load once per script — 51+ layers
```

**Core pattern:** `reg$layers$lake`, `reg$layers$road`, `reg$layers$bec_zone`, etc.

### Translators

| Target | Simple layer | Classified layer |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| tmap | `gq_tmap_style(layer)` → `do.call(tm_polygons, ...)` | `gq_tmap_classes(layer)` → field, values, labels |
| mapgl | `gq_mapgl_style(layer)` → paint properties | `gq_mapgl_classes(layer)` → match expression |

### Custom styles

For project-specific layers not in the main registry, use a hand-curated CSV and merge:

```r
reg <- gq_reg_merge(gq_reg_main(), gq_reg_read_csv("path/to/custom.csv"))
```

Install: `pak::pak("NewGraphEnvironment/gq")`

## Map Targets

| Output | Tool | When |
|--------|------|------|
| PDF / print figures | `tmap` v4 | Bookdown PDF, static reports |
| Interactive HTML | `mapgl` (MapLibre GL) | Bookdown gitbook, memos, web pages |
| QGIS project | Native QML | Field work, Mergin Maps |

## Key Rules

- **`sf_use_s2(FALSE)`** at top of every mapping script
- **Compute area BEFORE simplify** in SQL
- **No map title** — title belongs in the report caption
- **Legend over least-important terrain** — swap legend and logo sides when it reduces AOI occlusion. No fixed convention for which side.
- **Four-corner rule** — legend, logo, scale bar, keymap each get their own corner. Never stack two in the same quadrant.
- **Bbox must match canvas aspect ratio** — compute the ratio from geographic extents and page dimensions. Mismatch causes white space bands.
- **Consistent element-to-frame spacing** — all inset elements should have visually equal margins from the frame edge
- **Map fills to frame** — basemap extends edge-to-edge, no dead bands. Use near-zero `inner.margins` and `outer.margins`.
- **Suppress auto-legends** — build manual ones from registry values
- **ALL CAPS labels appear larger** — use title case for legend labels (gq `gq_tmap_classes()` handles this automatically via `to_title()` fallback)

## Self-Review (after every render)

Read the PNG and check before showing anyone:

1. Correct polygon/study area shown? (verify source data, not just the bbox)
2. Map fills the page? (no white/black bands)
3. Keymap inside frame with spacing from edge?
4. No element overlap? (each in its own corner)
5. Legend over least-important terrain?
6. Consistent spacing across all elements?
7. Scale bar breaks appropriate for extent?

See the `cartography` skill for full reference: basemap blending, BC spatial data queries, label hierarchy, mapgl gotchas, and worked examples.

## Land Cover Change

Use [drift](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/drift) and [flooded](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/flooded) together for riparian land cover change analysis. flooded delineates floodplain extents from DEMs and stream networks; drift tracks what's changing inside them over time.

**Pipeline:**

```r
# 1. Delineate floodplain AOI (flooded)
valleys <- flooded::fl_valley_confine(dem, streams)

# 2. Fetch, classify, summarize (drift)
rasters   <- drift::dft_stac_fetch(aoi, source = "io-lulc", years = c(2017, 2020, 2023))
classified <- drift::dft_rast_classify(rasters, source = "io-lulc")
summary    <- drift::dft_rast_summarize(classified, unit = "ha")

# 3. Interactive map with layer toggle
drift::dft_map_interactive(classified, aoi = aoi)
```

- Class colors come from drift's shipped class tables (IO LULC, ESA WorldCover)
- For production COGs on S3, `dft_map_interactive()` serves tiles via titiler — set `options(drift.titiler_url = "...")`
- See the [drift vignette](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/drift/articles/neexdzii-kwa.html) for a worked example (Neexdzii Kwa floodplain, 2017-2023)


# CI Monitoring

When this repo has GitHub Actions workflows, scan recent runs on session start. Catches failed pkgdown deploys, broken vignette builds, and stale citation regenerations that would otherwise linger until the user manually checks.

## On Session Start

```bash
gh run list --limit 5 --json status,conclusion,name,createdAt,databaseId \
  --jq '.[] | select(.conclusion == "failure")'
```

If any failures since the last visit, surface to the user before starting other work:

> Workflow `<name>` failed `<time>` ago (run `<id>`). Investigate with `gh run view <id> --log-failed`. Fix or proceed with current task?

User decides; do not auto-fix.

## Particular Failures Worth Naming

- **pkgdown** — docs site on GitHub Pages broken
- **R-CMD-check** — package may not install
- **Vignette / build-vignettes** — vignette docs incomplete
- **update-citation-cff** — CITATION.cff stale

## Why This Matters

Without this scan, post-merge workflow failures linger until someone (often the user) notices a stale docs site or a missing vignette. The session-start sweep catches them on the first re-entry into the repo.

## Pairs with `/gh-pr-merge`

The skill watches workflows triggered by a fresh merge in real time — that's the targeted catch. This convention is the backstop for failures that landed when no one was watching (merges via web UI, scheduled triggers, manually-triggered workflows).


# Code Check Conventions

Structured checklist for reviewing diffs before commit. Used by `/code-check`.
Add new checks here when a bug class is discovered — they compound over time.

## Shell Scripts

### Quoting
- Variables in double-quoted strings containing single quotes break if value has `'`
- `"echo '${VAR}'"` — if VAR contains `'`, shell syntax breaks
- Use `printf '%s\n' "$VAR" | command` to pipe values safely
- Heredocs: unquoted `<<EOF` expands variables locally, `<<'EOF'` does not — know which you need
- Pass-through-ssh args: `printf '%q'` escapes per-arg so workload paths with spaces / quotes / metacharacters survive the local-shell → ssh-argv → remote-shell round-trip. Without it, `ssh host 'cmd' "$path"` joins args with spaces on remote and re-parses, losing argument boundaries.

### Heredoc precedence in pipelines
- `cmd1 | cmd2 <<EOF` — the heredoc binds to `cmd2` (the rightmost simple command). If you intended `cmd1` to receive it, put `<<EOF` on cmd1 explicitly: `cmd1 <<EOF | cmd2`.
- Symptom when wrong: ssh body silently echoed by tee/cat/etc, ssh side gets empty stdin, exits 0 (or near-0) without doing anything. Caught the hard way 2026-05-01 in cypher_restore-fwapg.sh.

### pipefail with ssh+tee
- `set -eu` does NOT propagate exit codes through pipelines. `ssh ... | tee log` returns tee's exit (always 0 for healthy tee), masking ssh failure.
- Use `set -euo pipefail` for any script that pipes a meaningful command into tee/cat/grep/etc. Or check `${PIPESTATUS[0]}` explicitly.
- Symptom when wrong: task notifications report "exit 0 / completed" while remote work was actually skipped or errored.

### Paths
- Hardcoded absolute paths (`/Users/airvine/...`) break for other users
- Use `REPO_ROOT="$(cd "$(dirname "$0")/<relative>" && pwd)"`
- After moving scripts, verify `../` depth still resolves correctly
- Usage comments should match actual script location

### Silent Failures
- `|| true` hides real errors — is the failure actually safe to ignore?
- Empty variable before destructive operation (rm, destroy) — add guard: `[ -n "$VAR" ] || exit 1`
- `grep` returning empty silently — downstream commands get empty input

### Process Visibility
- Secrets passed as command-line args are visible in `ps aux`
- Use env files, stdin pipes, or temp files with `chmod 600` instead

## Cloud-Init (YAML)

### ASCII
- Must be pure ASCII — em dashes, curly quotes, arrows cause silent parse failure
- Check with: `perl -ne 'print "$.: $_" if /[^\x00-\x7F]/' file.yaml`

### YAML flow-mapping in runcmd
- Any runcmd item containing both `{` and `:` is at risk of being parsed as a YAML flow-mapping (dict), not a literal string. Cloud-init's shellify hits a non-string and throws TypeError, **aborting all subsequent runcmd steps silently** while `final_message` still fires.
- Don't write: `- test -s /file || { echo "FATAL: ..." }` — the `:` inside braces makes YAML see a dict.
- Do write: use `- |` block scalar with explicit `if/then/fi`:
  ```yaml
  - |
    if [ ! -s /file ]; then
      echo "FATAL: ..." >&2
      exit 1
    fi
  ```
- Validate post-edit: `python3 -c "import yaml; runcmd=yaml.safe_load(open('cloud-init.yaml').read().split(chr(10),1)[1])['runcmd']; print([type(x).__name__ for x in runcmd if not isinstance(x,str)] or 'all strings')"`. If the output is anything other than `all strings`, the runcmd will fail.

### State
- `cloud-init clean` causes full re-provisioning on next boot — almost never what you want before snapshot
- Use `tailscale logout` not `tailscale down` before snapshot (deregister vs disconnect)
- Wipe `/var/lib/tailscale/*` before snapshot too — `tailscale logout` deauthorizes server-side but local node identity blob persists in tailscaled.state. Snapshot restored elsewhere inherits prior key material until `tailscale up` runs again.
- Wipe `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_*` before snapshot — otherwise droplets spawned from the same image share host identity.

### Template Variables
- Secrets rendered via `templatefile()` are readable at `169.254.169.254` metadata endpoint
- Acceptable for ephemeral machines, document the tradeoff
- Heredocs in runcmd that write secrets: `<<'EOF'` (quoted) prevents bash from re-expanding `$X` sequences in already-substituted credential strings. AWS keys rarely contain `$` but base64-padded secrets might.

### Repo + key install ordering
- `apt-key adv --keyserver` is deprecated on Ubuntu 24.04 noble — silently fails AND APT ignores resulting keyring. Use `gpg --dearmor` + `signed-by=` keyring file pattern.
- Repo .list files in `write_files:` trigger the implicit `package_update` BEFORE runcmd installs the keyring → first apt-get update fails with NO_PUBKEY. Put the repo line in runcmd alongside the key install, not in write_files.

### Cloud-init users vs DO SSH key injection
- DO injects `ssh_key_ids` only into `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` (cloud-init's `cc_ssh` module). Cloud-init `users:` block with `ssh_authorized_keys: []` does NOT pick those up.
- Non-root users that need SSH access must copy from root's keys in runcmd:
  ```yaml
  - mkdir -p /home/<user>/.ssh
  - cp /root/.ssh/authorized_keys /home/<user>/.ssh/authorized_keys
  - chown -R <user>:<user> /home/<user>/.ssh
  ```
- Guard with `test -s /root/.ssh/authorized_keys` to fail loudly if `cc_ssh` hasn't run before runcmd (rare race).

## OpenTofu / Terraform

### State
- Parsing `tofu state show` text output is fragile — use `tofu output` instead
- Missing outputs that scripts need — add them to main.tf
- Snapshot/image IDs in tfvars after deleting the snapshot — stale reference

### Destructive Operations
- Validate resource IDs before destroy: `[ -n "$ID" ] || exit 1`
- `tofu destroy` without `-target` destroys everything including reserved IPs
- Snapshot ID extraction by name: use `awk -v n="$NAME" '$2 == n {print $1}'` (exact match on column 2). `grep -F "$NAME"` is substring-match and can grab a stale snapshot whose name contains the new name as a substring.

## DigitalOcean

### Snapshot disk-size constraint
- DO snapshots include the source droplet's disk size. New droplets from a snapshot must have disk **>=** snapshot disk. Resize **up** is fine; resize **down** below the snapshot disk is impossible without rebuilding.
- Build the snapshot at the smallest droplet size you'd ever want to spin from it. Sizes vs disks at writing: `g-4vcpu-16gb` = 50 GB, `g-8vcpu-32gb` / `m-4vcpu-32gb` = 100 GB, `m-8vcpu-64gb` = 200 GB.
- If your workload requires X GB RAM minimum, your snapshot floor is whatever droplet has X GB AND the smallest disk class.

### Reserved IP detach behavior
- Targeted destroy (`tofu destroy -target=module.droplet -target=...assignment...`) preserves the reserved IP at $4/mo. Full `tofu destroy` releases it (next apply gets a NEW IP).

### Reserved IP assignment race (rtj#55, rtj#85)
- DO returns 422 "Droplet already has a pending event" when reserved IP assignment fires immediately after droplet+firewall creation. The droplet's internal event queue takes time to drain.
- **Every DO droplet module that uses a reserved IP MUST have:**
  1. `time_sleep` resource between droplet creation and IP assignment, with `create_duration ≥ 60s` (10s and 30s have both been observed to race; 60s has more headroom)
  2. `depends_on = [time_sleep.<name>]` on the `digitalocean_reserved_ip_assignment` resource
  3. A retry fallback in the wrapping shell script (`up.sh` style) that detects the 422 in tofu output and uses `doctl compute reserved-ip-action assign <ip> <droplet-id>` to recover. Tofu doesn't retry; it leaves state half-applied (assignment recorded but DO didn't actually attach).
- **Snapshot-based spins are MORE prone to the race** than first-boot from blank Ubuntu (more startup events compete for the droplet's event queue).
- **Audit existing modules:** `grep -L 'time_sleep' env/do/*/<host>/main.tf` finds modules missing the gate. As of 2026-05-02, openclaw and geoserv have no `time_sleep` — they will race eventually.

## Docker / Postgres

### Postgis init time
- `imresamu/postgis` (and similar postgis images) on first cold start (empty data volume) take **5-12 min** to install all extensions — varies with disk IO and noisy-neighbor lottery on cloud hosts. Health-wait scripts must allow 15 min minimum, ideally with hard-fail + log dump on timeout.

### Tuning vs host RAM
- fresh's `docker/docker-compose.yml` defaults are tuned for a 128 GB host (`shared_buffers=32GB`, `shm_size=36gb`). On smaller hosts, postgres OOMs at startup with "could not map anonymous shared memory".
- 32 GB host floor: use the M1/cypher 32 GB-host preset (`scripts/fwapg/compose.override.m1.yml`) which sets `shared_buffers=8GB, shm_size=12gb`.
- Below 32 GB: postgres can technically start with smaller `shared_buffers` but fwapg work becomes painful. Don't run fwapg pipelines on <32 GB hosts.

### `search_path` is data, not config
- `ALTER DATABASE <db> SET search_path TO ...` is a database-level setting **stored in the postgres data dir**. Wiped with `docker compose down -v`. Must be re-applied on every restore.
- Codify in your restore script, not in cloud-init or compose env (those don't apply to db-level settings).

## Tailscale

### ACL "users" semantics
- Tailscale SSH ACL `"users": ["autogroup:nonroot"]` for `tag:compute` blocks `ssh root@<node>` over the tailnet. Use `ssh <user>@<node>` + sudo for root operations.
- For SSH-as-root from off-tailnet (regular OpenSSH on the public IP), the ACL doesn't apply — but you need the SSH key registered on the node.

### Reusable + ephemeral auth keys
- Cypher-style ephemeral compute droplets need both flags on the auth key: **Reusable** (same key works across destroy/recreate) + **Ephemeral** (tailnet entries auto-clean when offline >5 min).
- Tag the key (e.g. `tag:compute`) at creation time. Nodes joining with that key inherit the tag automatically — no `--advertise-tags` needed at `tailscale up` time.

## Security

### Secrets in Committed Files
- `.tfvars` must be gitignored (contains tokens, passwords)
- `.tfvars.example` should have all variables with empty/placeholder values
- Sensitive variables need `sensitive = true` in variables.tf

### Firewall Defaults
- `0.0.0.0/0` for SSH is world-open — document if intentional
- If access is gated by Tailscale, say so explicitly

### Credentials
- Passwords with special chars (`'`, `"`, `$`, `!`) break naive shell quoting
- `printf '%q'` escapes values for shell safety
- Temp files for secrets: create with `chmod 600`, delete after use

## R / Package Installation

### pak Behavior
- pak stops on first unresolvable package — all subsequent packages are skipped
- Removed CRAN packages (like `leaflet.extras`) must move to GitHub source
- PPPM binaries may lag a few hours behind new CRAN releases

### Reproducibility
- Branch pins (`pkg@branch`) are not reproducible — document why used
- Pinned download URLs (RStudio .deb) go stale — document where to update

## General

### Adopting Existing Config

When importing config from one location into a canonical one (legacy `~/.bash_profile` → dotfiles repo, old script's env → repo, another project's `settings.json` → soul):

- **Verify every referenced path/binary exists.** Dead PATH exports, missing interpreters, stale env vars should be cut, not codified.
  Shell paths: `for p in $(echo "$PATH" | tr ':' ' '); do [ -d "$p" ] || echo "DEAD: $p"; done`
- **Ask before dropping a reference** — it may be something the user forgot to reinstall on this machine, not something to delete.
- **Curated subset, not verbatim copy.** The diff should reflect what you verified, not the whole source.

### Documentation Staleness
- Moving/renaming scripts: update CLAUDE.md, READMEs, usage comments
- New variables: update .tfvars.example
- New workflows: update relevant README


# NGE Feature Workflow

For non-trivial issue-driven work, follow this checklist. Each step exists for a reason — skipping leads to rework, broken builds, and avoidable bugs that we've hit repeatedly.

## The Sequence

1. **Start with `/planning-init <N>`** — given an issue number, enters plan mode for codebase exploration, presents a phase breakdown for user approval, then scaffolds branch + PWF baseline with the approved phases. One command replaces the manual issue → explore → plan → branch → scaffold dance.
2. **Write robust tests first** — failing tests that reproduce the issue or document the new behavior. Tests are the contract; they fail until the work makes them pass.
3. **Name with intent** — functions, parameters, internal helpers carry the naming style of the package they live in. Look at existing exports as the guide; consistency over cleverness. (Per-package naming convention TBD — see soul issue tracking.)
4. **Examples that run** — every exported function gets a runnable `@examples` block. Pkgdown renders them; CI executes them. An example that doesn't run is documentation rot.
5. **Code-check before each commit** — `/code-check` on staged diff. Catches what tests miss: edge cases, hard-coded paths, unguarded variables, security issues.
6. **Atomic commits** — each commit bundles code change + checkbox flip in `task_plan.md`. The diff and the progress live in the same commit; `git log -- planning/` tells the full story.
7. **`/planning-archive` when complete** — moves PWF to `archive/YYYY-MM-issue-N-slug/`, creates a fresh `active/`. Then `/gh-pr-push` opens the PR; `/gh-pr-merge` handles the release bookkeeping.

## When to Skip

For one-line typo fixes, version-bump-only PRs, or trivial documentation edits, the full workflow is overhead. Use judgment. The threshold is roughly: **multi-step issue, multi-file change, or anything that requires scoping** → use the workflow.

## Skills That Slot In

- `/planning-init <N>` — start
- `/planning-update` — sync checkboxes mid-session
- `/code-check` — before every commit
- `/planning-archive` — when issue closes
- `/gh-pr-push` — open the PR
- `/gh-pr-merge` — merge with release bookkeeping

## Why This Exists

We've hit snags repeatedly when half-doing this — branches that mix concerns, tests bolted on after, code-check skipped (and then a bug ships in the diff), examples that fail in pkgdown. Each step is small; the cumulative reliability gain is real. The convention is here so it becomes the default expectation, not a thing the user has to remind every session about.


# LLM Behavioral Guidelines

<!-- Source: https://github.com/forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills/main/CLAUDE.md -->
<!-- Last synced: 2026-02-06 -->
<!-- These principles are hardcoded locally. We do not curl at deploy time. -->
<!-- Periodically check the source for meaningful updates. -->

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.


**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.


# New Graph Environment Conventions

Core patterns for professional, efficient workflows across New Graph Environment repositories.

## Ecosystem Overview

Six repos form the governance and operations layer across all New Graph Environment work:

| Repo | Purpose | Analogy |
|------|---------|---------|
| [compass](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/compass) | Ethics, values, guiding principles | The "why" |
| [soul](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/soul) | Standards, skills, conventions for LLM agents | The "how" |
| [compost](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/compost) | Communications templates, email workflows, contact management | The "who" |
| [rtj](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/rtj) (formerly awshak) | Infrastructure as Code, deployment | The "where" |
| [gq](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/gq) | Cartographic style management across QGIS, tmap, leaflet, web | The "look" |
| [crate](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/crate) | Data governance: canonical schemas, data dictionary, QC rules (scoping; normalization functions are Year 2+) | The "what" |

**Adaptive management:** Conventions evolve from real project work, not theory. When a pattern is learned or refined during project work, propagate it back to soul so all projects benefit. The `/claude-md-init` skill builds each project's `CLAUDE.md` from soul conventions.

**Cross-references:** [sred](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/sred) tracks R&D activities across repos. Compost is the centralized communications workflow — all email drafts, contact registry, and external outreach are authored there, not in individual project repos.

## Three-Layer Repo Architecture

Repos live in one of three layers, distinguished by audience and what context they carry:

| Layer | Role | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Public — tools** | Atomic, reusable, no NGE-specific context | R packages (`mc`, `crate`, `fresh`, `drift`, `flooded`, `gq`, `link`), `bcfishpass`, `fwapg`, STAC catalogs, post-publication reports |
| **Private — coordination** | How tools compose into NGE workflows. The competitive moat. | `compost` (uses `mc`), `rfp` (uses `fresh`/`link`/etc.), `rtj` (uses `crate`, deploys), `fish_passage_template_reporting`, all proposals (never public) |
| **Private — governance** | Strategy, values, conventions, R&D | `soul`, `logic`, `compass`, `sred` |

**Rule:** tools don't know about each other or about NGE. Coordination repos know how to use tools. `mc/CLAUDE.md` does not know `compost` exists; `compost/CLAUDE.md` knows "for email use `mc`."

**Publication flip:** when a private repo flips public (e.g., `crate` once `link` requires it; reports on publication), three things happen in the same commit: removed from comms peer list, `comms/` directory purged, `CLAUDE.md` scrubbed to public-safe form. Use `/claude-md-init --public-clean` for the scrub.

**Per-repo classification** is recorded in `.claude/visibility` (one line: `public` or `internal`; default `internal` if missing). Soul conventions carry `visibility:` frontmatter (`public-safe` or `internal`); `/claude-md-init` filter skips internal-only conventions when repo is marked public.

Strategic call recorded in `logic/comms/soul/20260428_public_vs_internal_repo_architecture.md`.

## Issue Workflow

### Before Creating an Issue (non-negotiable)

1. **Check for duplicates:** `gh issue list --state open --search "<keywords>"` -- search before creating
2. **One issue, one concern.** Keep focused.

SRED cross-refs go in **PR bodies only** (via `/gh-pr-push`), not in issues or commits. PRs aggregate commits and are the merge unit; per-issue and per-commit SRED tags add noise without adding traceability.

### Professional Issue Writing

Write issues with clear technical focus:

- **Use normal technical language** in titles and descriptions
- **Focus on the problem and solution** approach
- **Add tracking links at the end** (e.g., `Relates to Owner/repo#N`)

#### Client-aware tone

Issues, PR descriptions, and commit messages are client-visible deliverables, not internal notes.

Avoid in these artifacts:
- Framing work as unsolicited or unpaid ("not assigned by a client")
- Self-justifying adjectives ("defensible", "rigorous") — show, don't claim
- Internal workflow meta (PWF refs, SRED xrefs, planning context)
- Performative effort language ("attempts were unsuccessful") — state factual current state

**Integrity-preserving ≠ self-effacing.** Factual, not performatively humble.

**Scope:** repo artifacts (issues, PRs, commits, reports). Does not apply to internal planning docs, CLAUDE.md, or chat.

**Issue body structure:**
```markdown
## Problem
<what's wrong or missing>

## Proposed Solution
<approach>

Relates to #<local>
```

### GitHub Issue Creation - Always Use Files

The `gh issue create` command with heredoc syntax fails repeatedly with EOF errors. ALWAYS use `--body-file`:

```bash
cat > /tmp/issue_body.md << 'EOF'
## Problem
...

## Proposed Solution
...
EOF

gh issue create --title "Brief technical title" --body-file /tmp/issue_body.md
```

## Closing Issues

**DO:** Close issues via commit messages. The commit IS the closure and the documentation.

```
Fix broken DEM path in loading pipeline

Update hardcoded path to use config-driven resolution.

Fixes #20
Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

**DON'T:** Close issues with `gh issue close`. This breaks the audit trail — there's no linked diff showing what changed.

- `Fixes #N` or `Closes #N` — auto-closes and links the commit to the issue
- `Relates to #N` — partial progress, does not close
- Always close issues when work is complete. Don't leave stale open issues.

## Commit Quality

Write clear, informative commit messages:

```
Brief description (50 chars or less)

Detailed explanation of changes and impact.

Fixes #<issue> (or Relates to #<issue>)

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

**When to commit:**
- Logical, atomic units of work
- Working state (tests pass)
- Clear description of changes

**What to avoid:**
- "WIP" or "temp" commits in main branch
- Combining unrelated changes
- Vague messages like "fixes" or "updates"

## LLM Agent Conventions

Rules learned from real project sessions. These apply across all repos.

- **Install missing packages, don't workaround** — if a package is needed, ask the user to install it (e.g. `pak::pak("pkg")`). Don't write degraded fallback code to avoid the dependency.
- **Never hardcode extractable data** — if coordinates, station names, or metadata can be pulled from an API or database at runtime, do that. Don't hardcode values that have a programmatic source.
- **Close issues via commits, not `gh issue close`** — see Closing Issues above.
- **Cite primary sources** — see references conventions.

## Naming Conventions

**Pattern: `noun_verb-detail`** -- noun first, verb second across all naming:

| What | Example |
|------|---------|
| Skills | `claude-md-init`, `gh-issue-create`, `planning-update` |
| Scripts | `stac_register-baseline.sh`, `stac_register-pypgstac.sh` |
| Logs | `20260209_stac_register-baseline_stac-dem-bc.txt` |
| Log format | `yyyymmdd_noun_verb-detail_target.ext` |

Scripts and logs live together: `scripts/<module>/logs/`

## Projects vs Milestones

- **Projects** = daily cross-repo tracking (always add to relevant project)
- **Milestones** = iteration boundaries (only for release/claim prep)
- Don't double-track unless there's a reason

| Content | Project |
|---------|---------|
| R&D, experiments, SRED-related | **SRED R&D Tracking (#8)** |
| Data storage, sqlite, postgres, pipelines | **Data Architecture (#9)** |
| Fish passage field/reporting | **Fish Passage 2025 (#6)** |
| Restoration planning | **Aquatic Restoration Planning (#5)** |
| QGIS, Mergin, field forms | **Collaborative GIS (#3)** |


# Planning Conventions

How Claude manages structured planning for complex tasks using planning-with-files (PWF).

## When to Plan

Use PWF when a task has multiple phases, requires research, or involves more than ~5 tool calls. Triggers:
- User says "let's plan this", "plan mode", "use planning", or invokes `/planning-init`
- Complex issue work begins (multi-step, uncertain approach)
- Claude judges the task warrants structured tracking

Skip planning for single-file edits, quick fixes, or tasks with obvious next steps.

## The Workflow

1. **Explore first** — Enter plan mode (read-only). Read code, trace paths, understand the problem before proposing anything.
2. **Plan to files** — Write the plan into 3 files in `planning/active/`:
   - `task_plan.md` — Phases with checkbox tasks
   - `findings.md` — Research, discoveries, technical analysis
   - `progress.md` — Session log with timestamps and commit refs
3. **Plan-review with the Plan agent before committing the plan** — After scaffolding `task_plan.md` but BEFORE the baseline commit, spawn the Plan subagent (`Agent({subagent_type: "Plan", prompt: "..."}`) and ask it to critically review the task_plan against the issue body + actual codebase. Categorize findings as Blocker / Gap / Ordering / Assumption / Scope / Acceptance. Address each before committing. The agent reads files fresh — it catches what you miss when you've been thinking about the design too long. Real example: caught 21 issues including hardcoded literals across 4 files not listed in the plan, untested DB column mismatches, unfixable test-literal-string assertions, and a baseline-cache-shadow that would have produced a 6-second no-op run. Cost: ~5 min agent. Saves: hours of mid-implementation rework.
4. **Commit the plan** — After Plan-agent review + fixes. This is the baseline.
5. **Work in atomic commits** — Each commit bundles code changes WITH checkbox updates in the planning files. The diff shows both what was done and the checkbox marking it done.
6. **Code check before commit** — Run `/code-check` on staged diffs before committing. Don't mark a task done until the diff passes review.
7. **Archive when complete** — Move `planning/active/` to `planning/archive/` via `/planning-archive`. Write a README.md in the archive directory with a one-paragraph outcome summary and closing commit/PR ref — future sessions scan these to catch up fast.

## Atomic Commits (Critical)

Every commit that completes a planned task MUST include:
- The code/script changes
- The checkbox update in `task_plan.md` (`- [ ]` -> `- [x]`)
- A progress entry in `progress.md` if meaningful

This creates a git audit trail where `git log -- planning/` tells the full story. Each commit is self-documenting — you can backtrack with git and understand everything that happened.

## File Formats

### task_plan.md

Phases with checkboxes. This is the core tracking file.

```markdown
# Task Plan

## Phase 1: [Name]
- [ ] Task description
- [ ] Another task

## Phase 2: [Name]
- [ ] Task description
```

Mark tasks done as they're completed: `- [x] Task description`

### findings.md

Append-only research log. Discoveries, technical analysis, things learned.

```markdown
# Findings

## [Topic]
[What was found, with source/date]
```

### progress.md

Session entries with commit references.

```markdown
# Progress

## Session YYYY-MM-DD
- Completed: [items]
- Commits: [refs]
- Next: [items]
```

## Directory Structure

```
planning/
  active/          <- Current work (3 PWF files)
  archive/         <- Completed issues
    YYYY-MM-issue-N-slug/
```

If `planning/` doesn't exist in the repo, run `/planning-init` first.

## Skills

| Skill | When to use |
|-------|-------------|
| `/planning-init` | First time in a repo — creates directory structure |
| `/planning-update` | Mid-session — sync checkboxes and progress |
| `/planning-archive` | Issue complete — archive and create fresh active/ |


# R Package Development Conventions

Standards for R package development across New Graph Environment repositories.
Based on [R Packages (2e)](https://r-pkgs.org/) by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan.

**Reference packages:** When starting a new package, study these existing
packages for patterns: `flooded`, `gq`. They demonstrate the conventions below
in practice (DESCRIPTION fields, README layout, NEWS.md style, pkgdown setup,
test structure, hex sticker, etc.).

## Style

- tidyverse style guide: snake_case, pipe operators (`|>` or `%>%`)
- Match existing patterns in each codebase
- Use `pak` for package installation (not `install.packages`)
- Prefix column name vectors with `cols_` for discoverability in the
  environment pane: `cols_all`, `cols_carry`, `cols_split`, `cols_writable`.
  Same principle for other grouped vectors (`params_`, `tbl_`, etc.)
- For SQL DDL+INSERT pairs that share a schema, use a single named
  vector as the source of truth. Both `CREATE TABLE` and
  `INSERT (cols) SELECT cols` derive their column lists from the same
  `cols_*` vector. Avoids drift between table shape and write
  projection — when columns change, you edit one place. Example:
  ```r
  cols_streams <- c(
    id_segment           = "integer NOT NULL",
    watershed_group_code = "varchar(4) NOT NULL",
    geom                 = "geometry(MultiLineStringZM, 3005)"
    # …
  )
  # CREATE TABLE consumes both names + types
  ddl_body <- paste(names(cols_streams), unname(cols_streams), sep = " ",
                    collapse = ", ")
  # INSERT consumes names only
  proj <- paste(names(cols_streams), collapse = ", ")
  ```

## Package Structure

Follow R Packages (2e) conventions:
- `R/` for functions, `tests/testthat/` for tests, `man/` for docs
- `DESCRIPTION` with proper fields (Title, Description, Authors@R)
- `DESCRIPTION` URL field: include both the GitHub repo and the pkgdown site
  so pkgdown links correctly (e.g., `URL: https://github.com/OWNER/PKG,
  https://owner.github.io/PKG/`)
- `NAMESPACE` managed by roxygen2 (`#' @export`, `#' @import`, `#' @importFrom`)
- Never edit `NAMESPACE` or `man/` by hand

## One Function, One File

Each exported function gets its own R file and its own test file:
- `R/fl_mask.R` → `tests/testthat/test-fl_mask.R`
- Commit the function and its tests together
- Use `Fixes #N` in the commit message to close the corresponding issue

## GitHub Issues and SRED Tracking

### Issue-per-function workflow

File a GitHub issue for each function before building it. This creates a
traceable record of what was planned, built, and verified.

### Branching for SRED

For new packages or major features, work on a branch and merge via PR:

```
main ← scaffold-branch (PR closes with "Relates to NewGraphEnvironment/sred#N")
```

This gives one PR that contains all commits — a single SRED cross-reference
covers the entire body of work. Individual commits within the branch close
their respective function issues with `Fixes #N`.

### Closing issues

Close function issues via commit messages — see Closing Issues in newgraph conventions.

## Testing

- Use testthat 3e (`Config/testthat/edition: 3` in DESCRIPTION)
- Run `devtools::test()` before committing
- Test files mirror source: `R/utils.R` -> `tests/testthat/test-utils.R`
- Test for edge cases and potential failures, not just happy paths
- Tests must pass before closing the function's issue
- Always grep for errors in the same command as the test run to avoid
  running twice:
  ```bash
  Rscript -e 'devtools::test()' 2>&1 | grep -E "(FAIL|ERROR|PASS)" | tail -5
  ```
  For error context: `grep -E "(ERROR:|FAIL )" -A 10 | head -25`

## Examples and Vignettes

### Runnable examples on every exported function

Examples are how users discover what a function does. They must:
- **Actually run** — no `\dontrun{}` unless external resources are required
- **Use bundled test data** via `system.file()` so they work for anyone
- **Show why the function is useful** — not just that it runs, but what it
  produces and why you'd use it
- **Use qualified names** for non-exported dependencies (`terra::rast()`,
  `sf::st_read()`) since examples run in the user's environment

### Vignettes

At least one vignette showing the full pipeline on real data:
- Demonstrates the package solving an actual problem end-to-end
- Uses bundled test data (committed to `inst/testdata/`)
- Hosted on pkgdown so users can read it without installing

**Output format:** Use `bookdown::html_vignette2` (not
`rmarkdown::html_vignette`) for figure numbering and cross-references.
Requires `bookdown` in Suggests and chunks must have `fig.cap` for
numbered figures. Cross-reference with `Figure \@ref(fig:chunk-name)`.

**Vignettes that need external resources (DB, API, STAC):** Do NOT use
the `.Rmd.orig` pre-knit pattern — it breaks `bookdown` figure numbering
because knitr evaluates chunks during pre-knit and emits `![](path)`
markdown that bookdown can't number.

Instead, separate data generation from presentation:
1. `data-raw/vignette_data.R` — runs the queries, saves results as `.rds`
   to `inst/testdata/` (or `inst/vignette-data/`)
2. Vignette loads `.rds` files, all chunks run live during pkgdown build
3. Note at top of vignette: "Data generated by `data-raw/script.R`"
4. bookdown controls all chunks — figure numbers, cross-refs work

This is the same pattern as test data: `data-raw/` documents how the data
was produced, committed artifacts make vignettes reproducible without the
external resource.

### Test data

- Created via a script in `data-raw/` that documents exactly how the data
  was produced (database queries, spatial crops, etc.)
- Committed to `inst/testdata/` — small enough to ship with the package
- Used by tests, examples, and vignettes — one dataset, three purposes

## Documentation

- roxygen2 for all exported functions
- `@import` or `@importFrom` in the package-level doc (`R/<pkg>-package.R`)
  to populate NAMESPACE — don't rely on `::` everywhere in function bodies
- pkgdown site for public packages with `_pkgdown.yml` (bootstrap 5)
- GitHub Action for pkgdown (`usethis::use_github_action("pkgdown")`)

## lintr

Run `lintr::lint_package()` before committing R package code. Fix all warnings — every lint should be worth fixing.

### Recommended .lintr config

```r
linters: linters_with_defaults(
    line_length_linter(120),
    object_name_linter(styles = c("snake_case", "dotted.case")),
    commented_code_linter = NULL
  )
exclusions: list(
    "renv" = list(linters = "all")
  )
```

- 120 char line length (default 80 is too strict for data pipelines)
- Allow dotted.case (common in base R and legacy code)
- Suppress commented code lints (exploratory R scripts often have commented alternatives)
- Exclude renv directory entirely

## Dependencies

- Minimize Imports — use `Suggests` for packages only needed in tests/vignettes
- Pin versions only when breaking changes are known
- Prefer packages already in the tidyverse ecosystem

## Releasing

1. Update `NEWS.md` — keep it concise:
   - First release: one line (e.g., "Initial release. Brief description.")
   - Later releases: describe what changed and why, not function-by-function.
     Link to the pkgdown reference page for details — don't duplicate it.
   - Don't list every function; the pkgdown reference page is the single
     source of truth for what's in the package.
2. Bump version in `DESCRIPTION` (e.g., `0.0.0.9000` → `0.1.0`) — as the **final** commit of the branch, after verification numbers/tests are final. Mid-branch bumps are premature and churn: additional code changes end up bundled inside a "release" that already claimed the version.
3. Commit as "Release vX.Y.Z"
4. Tag: `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push && git push --tags`

## Repository Setup

### Branch protection

Protect main from deletion and force pushes:

```bash
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/rulesets --method POST --input - <<'EOF'
{
  "name": "Protect main",
  "target": "branch",
  "enforcement": "active",
  "bypass_actors": [
    { "actor_id": 5, "actor_type": "RepositoryRole", "bypass_mode": "always" }
  ],
  "conditions": { "ref_name": { "include": ["refs/heads/main"], "exclude": [] } },
  "rules": [ { "type": "deletion" }, { "type": "non_fast_forward" } ]
}
EOF
```

### Scaffold checklist

- `usethis::create_package(".")`
- `usethis::use_mit_license("New Graph Environment Ltd.")`
- `usethis::use_testthat(edition = 3)`
- `usethis::use_pkgdown()`
- `usethis::use_github_action("pkgdown")`
- `usethis::use_directory("dev")` — reproducible setup script
- `usethis::use_directory("data-raw")` — data generation scripts
- Hex sticker via `hexSticker` (see `data-raw/make_hexsticker.R`)
- Set GitHub Pages to serve from `gh-pages` branch

### dev/dev.R

Keep a `dev/dev.R` file that documents every setup step. Not idempotent —
run interactively. This is the reproducible recipe for the package scaffold.

## README

Keep the README lean:
- Hex sticker, one-line description, install, example showing *why* it's
  useful
- Link to pkgdown vignette and function reference — don't duplicate them
- Don't maintain a function table — it's just another thing to keep updated
  and pkgdown's reference page is the single source of truth

## LLM Workflow

When an LLM assistant modifies R package code:
1. Run `lintr::lint_package()` — fix issues before committing
2. Run `devtools::test()` with error grep — ensure tests pass in one call:
   ```bash
   Rscript -e 'devtools::test()' 2>&1 | grep -E "(FAIL|ERROR|PASS)" | tail -5
   ```
3. Run `devtools::document()` and grep for results:
   ```bash
   Rscript -e 'devtools::document()' 2>&1 | grep -E "(Writing|Updating|warning)" | tail -10
   ```
4. Check `devtools::check()` passes for releases — capture results in one call:
   ```bash
   Rscript -e 'devtools::check()' 2>&1 | grep -E "(ERROR|WARNING|NOTE|errors|warnings|notes)" | tail -10
   ```


# Reference Management Conventions

How references flow between Claude Code, Zotero, and technical writing at New Graph Environment.

## Tool Routing

Three tools, different purposes. Use the right one.

| Need | Tool | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| Search by keyword, read metadata/fulltext, semantic search | **MCP `zotero_*` tools** | pyzotero, works with Zotero item keys |
| Look up by citation key (e.g., `irvine2020ParsnipRiver`) | **`/zotero-lookup` skill** | Citation keys are a BBT feature — pyzotero can't resolve them |
| Create items, attach PDFs, deduplicate | **`/zotero-api` skill** | Connector API for writes, JS console for attachments |

**Citation keys vs item keys:** Citation keys (like `irvine2020ParsnipRiver`) come from Better BibTeX. Item keys (like `K7WALMSY`) are native Zotero. The MCP works with item keys. `/zotero-lookup` bridges citation keys to item data.

**BBT citation key storage:** As of Feb 2025+, BBT stores citation keys as a `citationKey` field directly in `zotero.sqlite` (via Zotero's item data system), not in a separate BBT database. The old `better-bibtex.sqlite` and `better-bibtex.migrated` files are stale and no longer updated. Query citation keys with: `SELECT idv.value FROM items i JOIN itemData id ON i.itemID = id.itemID JOIN itemDataValues idv ON id.valueID = idv.valueID JOIN fields f ON id.fieldID = f.fieldID WHERE f.fieldName = 'citationKey'`.

## Adding References Workflow

### 1. Search and flag

When research turns up a reference:
- **DOI available:** Tell the user — Zotero's magic wand (DOI lookup) is the fastest path
- **ResearchGate link:** Flag to user for manual check — programmatic fetch is blocked (403), but full text is often there
- **BC gov report:** Search [ACAT](https://a100.gov.bc.ca/pub/acat/), for.gov.bc.ca library, EIRS viewer
- **Paywalled:** Note it, move on. Don't waste time trying to bypass.

### 2. Add to Zotero

**Preferred order:**
1. DOI magic wand in Zotero UI (fastest, most complete metadata)
2. Web API POST with `collections` array (grey literature, local PDFs — targets collection directly, no UI interaction needed)
3. `saveItems` via `/zotero-api` (batch creation from structured data — requires UI collection selection)
4. JS console script for group library (when connector can't target the right collection)

**Collection targeting:** `saveItems` drops items into whatever collection is selected in Zotero's UI. Always confirm with the user before calling it. **Web API bypasses this** — include `"collections": ["KEY"]` in the POST body. Find collection keys with `?q=name` search on the collections endpoint.

### 3. Attach PDFs

`saveItems` attachments silently fail. Don't use them. Instead:

1. **Web API S3 upload (preferred):** Create attachment item → get upload auth → build S3 body (Python: prefix + file bytes + suffix) → POST to S3 → register with uploadKey. Works without Zotero running. See `/zotero-api` skill section 4.
2. **JS console fallback:** Download with `curl`, attach via `item_attach_pdf.js` in Zotero JS console.
3. Verify attachment exists via MCP: `zotero_get_item_children`

### 4. Verify

After manual adds, confirm via MCP:
- `zotero_search_items` — find by title
- `zotero_get_item_metadata` — check fields are complete
- `zotero_get_item_children` — confirm PDF attached

### 5. Clean up

If duplicates were created (common with `saveItems` retries):
- Run `collection_dedup.js` via Zotero JS console
- It keeps the copy with the most attachments, trashes the rest

## In Reports (bookdown)

### Bibliography generation

```yaml
# index.Rmd — dynamic bib from Zotero via Better BibTeX
bibliography: "`r rbbt::bbt_write_bib('references.bib', overwrite = TRUE)`"
```

`rbbt` pulls from BBT, which syncs with Zotero. Edit references in Zotero → rebuild report → bibliography updates.

**Library targeting:** rbbt must know which Zotero library to search. This is set globally in `~/.Rprofile`:

```r
# default library — NewGraphEnvironment group (libraryID 9, group 4733734)
options(rbbt.default.library_id = 9)
```

Without this option, rbbt searches only the personal library (libraryID 1) and won't find group library references. The library IDs map to Zotero's internal numbering — use `/zotero-lookup` with `SELECT DISTINCT libraryID FROM citationkey` against the BBT database to discover available libraries.

### Citation syntax

- `[@key2020]` — parenthetical: (Author 2020)
- `@key2020` — narrative: Author (2020)
- `[@key1; @key2]` — multiple
- `nocite:` in YAML — include uncited references

### Cite primary sources

When a review paper references an older study, trace back to the original and cite it. Don't attribute findings to the review when the original exists. (See LLM Agent Conventions in `newgraph.md`.)

**When the original is unavailable** (paywalled, out of print, can't locate): use secondary citation format in the prose and include bib entries for both sources:

> Smith et al. (2003; as cited in Doctor 2022) found that...

Both `@smith2003` and `@doctor2022` go in the `.bib` file. The reader can then track down the original themselves. Flag incomplete metadata on the primary entry — it's better to have a partial reference than none at all.

## PDF Fallback Chain

When you need a PDF and the obvious URL doesn't work:

1. DOI resolver → publisher site (often has OA link)
2. Europe PMC (`europepmc.org/backend/ptpmcrender.fcgi?accid=PMC{ID}&blobtype=pdf`) — ncbi blocks curl
3. SciELO — needs `User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0` header
4. ResearchGate — flag to user for manual download
5. Semantic Scholar — sometimes has OA links
6. Ask user for institutional access

Always verify downloads: `file paper.pdf` should say "PDF document", not HTML.

## Searching Paper Content (ragnar)

### Setup (per project)
- `scripts/rag_build.R` — maps citation keys to Zotero PDF attachment keys, builds DuckDB
- `data/rag/` gitignored — store is local, not committed
- Dependencies: ragnar, Ollama with nomic-embed-text model
- See `/lit-search` skill for full recipe

### Query
`ragnar_store_connect()` then `ragnar_retrieve()` — returns chunks with source file attribution.

### Anti-patterns
- NEVER write abstracts manually — if CrossRef has no abstract, leave blank
- NEVER cite specific numbers without verifying from the source PDF via ragnar search
- NEVER paraphrase equations — copy exact notation and cite page/section


# SRED Conventions

How SR&ED tracking integrates with New Graph Environment's development workflows.

## The Claim: One Project

All SRED-eligible work across NGE falls under a **single continuous project**:

> **Dynamic GIS-based Data Processing and Reporting Framework**

- **Field:** Software Engineering (2.02.09)
- **Start date:** May 2022
- **Fiscal year:** May 1 – April 30
- **Consultant:** Boast Capital (prepares final technical report)

**Do not fragment work into separate claims.** Each fiscal year's work is structured as iterations within this one project. Internal tracking (experiment numbers in `sred`) maps to iterations — Boast assembles the final narrative.

## Tagging Work for SRED

### PRs (single enforcement point)

SRED cross-references (`Relates to NewGraphEnvironment/sred#N`) go in **PR body templates only** — not in issue bodies, commit messages, or any other surface. The `/gh-pr-push` skill is the single enforcement point. PRs aggregate commits and are the merge unit, so per-issue and per-commit SRED tags only add noise.

### Time entries (rolex)

Tag hours with `sred_ref` field linking to the relevant `sred` issue number.

## What Qualifies as SRED

**Eligible (systematic investigation to overcome technological uncertainty):**
- Building tools/functions that don't exist in standard practice
- Prototyping new integrations between systems (GIS ↔ reporting ↔ field collection)
- Testing whether an approach works and documenting why it did/didn't
- Iterating on failed approaches with new hypotheses

**Not eligible:**
- Standard configuration of known tools
- Routine bug fixes in working systems
- Writing reports using the framework (that's service delivery)

**The test:** "Did we try something we weren't sure would work, and did we learn something from the attempt?" If yes, it's likely eligible.
